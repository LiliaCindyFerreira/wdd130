                <h2>Hot Springs</h2>
                <p>The water from the hot springs comes from the Guaraní Aquifer System, the largest in South America. It constitutes one of the most important underground water resources, on the planet, due to its size and the quality and temperature of the water. In the region, tourists find multiple ways to take advantage of this resource: pools of all sizes, shapes, and water temperatures, relaxing showers, invigorating jet pools, and bubble baths are a temptation to rest, enjoy, and leave stress behind. These hot springs have close contact and communication with nature, surrounded by soft and undulating natural meadows furrowed by the water of rivers and creeks.</p>
